# 📚 Quiz site 📚
My final vanilla JavaScript project before heading into React! Build a quiz using a API.

# 🚀 What I learned:
How to handle errors using try.
The importance of keeping functions small and easy to read.
Refactoring: After almost finishing the project, I started over to use smaller and more readable functions. I’m reading a book about Clean Code, and while I don’t understand everything in it yet, it’s teaching me a lot. For example, function names should be clear enough that you might not even need comments.
LocalStorage: I now have more knowlage about using localstorage and getting the data from there.

# 🛠️ Areas for Improvement:
Desktop UI: I focused mostly on building the site for mobile.
Naming functions: I feel like I could do much better with naming.
